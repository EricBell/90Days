VOIDRULES - CODING RULES FOR BEGINNERS
========================================

Created: July 2025
Purpose: Simple coding rules to keep things organized and prevent mistakes

========================================
JAVASCRIPT RULES
========================================

VARIABLES:
- Always use `let` or `const`, never `var`
- Use `const` for values that don't change
- Use `let` for values that do change
- Give variables clear names: `userName` not `x`

CODE STYLE:
- Always end statements with semicolons (;)
- Use single quotes for strings: 'hello'
- Indent with 2 spaces
- Keep lines under 80 characters
- Put spaces around operators: `x + y` not `x+y`

SAFETY RULES:
- Use `===` instead of `==` for comparisons
- Always use curly braces for if statements
- Declare variables before using them

========================================
PYTHON RULES
========================================

VARIABLES:
- Use descriptive names: `user_name` not `x`
- Use lowercase with underscores: `my_variable`
- Don't leave unused variables in your code

CODE STYLE:
- Indent with 4 spaces (Python requires proper indenting)
- Keep lines under 88 characters
- Put imports at the top of files
- Leave 2 blank lines between functions

SAFETY RULES:
- Don't use undefined variables
- Add comments to explain complex code
- Keep functions simple and focused

========================================
GENERAL RULES FOR BOTH LANGUAGES
========================================

- Write code like you're explaining it to someone else
- Test your code frequently as you write it
- Save your work often
- Use meaningful names for everything

========================================
WHY THESE RULES MATTER
========================================

They prevent common mistakes and make your code professional from day one.

========================================
BEGINNER NOTES
========================================

- Start with these basic rules
- Don't worry about memorizing everything at once
- Focus on one rule at a time as you learn
- These rules will become natural with practice
- When in doubt, choose clarity over cleverness
